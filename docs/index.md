# atopile

`atopile` is a project building toolchains to bring the best of software development to the world of hardware design.

We're starting with an electronics compiler that takes uses a new language in `.ato` files to describe the hardware design, and compiles it to netlists that can be laid out and fabricated.

These `.ato` files are human readable, and can be version controlled, so you can collaborate with your team on the design of your hardware. They're modular, so you can reuse components from other projects, and share them with the community. They provide a way to save the intelligence of your design and the validation required to make sure it works as intended, so you can be confident that your design will work as expected.

## Intentional Omissions

- Detailed Installation -> instructions are in the `atopile` project's README.md and are fluid since there's a bunch of not-so-well-packaged components at the moment
- Creating new projects -> with a WIP syntax, we're intentionally avoiding lots of new projects to maintain.


## Project structure

The root of an ato project is marked by the presence of an `ato.yaml` file.

`ato.yaml` contains some project configuration information like the list of things you want to build. It's similar in concept to a `package.json` in js/node/npm land.

Here's an example:

```yaml
builds:
  default:
    # we don't have a default root file yet
    targets:
      - netlist-kicad6
      - designators
      - bom-jlcpcb
```


## Imports

You can import assets by specifying what you want to import and where you want to import it from with the following syntax:

`import What from "where.ato"`

Notes on that statement:
- quotes on the "where.ato" - it's a string
- `What` is capitalised - it's a type and types should be capitalised, though this isn't enforced and you can import things other than types from other files

The import statements are with respect to the current project, or within the standard library (`std`)


## Basic types

There's a handful of major types that you'll use in your `.ato` files, falling into two categories; blocks and nodes.

Blocks represent something that can contain other things. They provide an abstration over their contents.

Nodes are connectable quanta.

Block types are:
- `component` - represents exactly one component
- `module` - a collection of components and other modules
- `interface` - walks the line between a block and a node. It's a connectable block that let's you connect multiple nodes at a time

Node types are:
- `pin` - represents a physical pin/pad on a package
- `signal` - represents a logical signal that can be connected to other signals


## Block definition

Say we create a new file `led.ato` with the following contents:

```ato
component LED:
    signal positive  # declare a signal named "positive"
    positive ~ pin 1  # connect that "positive" signal with pin 1
    signal negative ~ pin 2  # declare a signal named "negative" and connect it with pin 2 in one line
    footprint = "Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric"  # yeah, I know this is a resistor package, but bare with me
```

## Viewing your first component

`ato view` is the tool for you!

`ato view --help` will give you a printout of the options it can take.

atopile paths are in the form `path/to/file.ato:module.within.file`

To view, the LED component for example: `ato view led.ato:LED`

You should get a browser window popping up and wham! bam! alakazam! you've got a component!

## Adding footprints to your project

[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) is a great place to get cheap PCBs made. They have a [library](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) of footprints that you can use.

To pull in a footprint, we've been using the wonderful tool [easyeda2kicad](https://pypi.org/project/easyeda2kicad/).

Add it to your python environment with `pip install easyeda2kicad`

Then you can download JLCPCB/EasyEDA/LCSC footprints with `easyeda2kicad --full --lcsc_id=<LCSC-num> --output ../lib/lib`

## Building the netlist

`ato build` is the tool for you!

For example: `ato build --target=netlist-kicad6 led.ato:LED`

This will generate a netlist in the `build/default` directory.

You can build any supported target with this same command just by changing the value of the `--target` option.

## Importing to KiCAD

While creating a new project and where to place your KiCAD files is out of scope of this tutorial, if you simply need to reimport a netlist into KiCAD, you can do the following:

1. File -> Import Netlist
![Import Netlist](images/file-import.png)
1. Select the netlist you've just generated. The output is in the terminal, but it should approximately be servo-drive/build/servo-drive.net
2. Make sure you're using unique IDs, rather than designators (though they should work too)
3. Ruthlessly destroy stuff that's not supposed to be there (check boxes on the right)
![Import Netlist 2](images/import-settings.png)
1. Check the errors - sometimes it's important


## More on blocks

Like classes in most modern languages, we can subclass and inherit from blocks.

```ato
module SomeModule:
    signal some_signal
    signal gnd
    some_variable = "some value"

module SubclassedModule from SomeModule:
    # inherits all the signals and variables from SomeModule
    # we don't need to declare the signals again, but we will replace the value of some_variable
    some_variable = "some other value"

module Test:
    signal gnd
    subclased_module = new SubclassedModule  # creates an instance of the SubclassedModule
    subclased_module.gnd ~ gnd  # connects the some_signal of the SubclassedModule to the gnd of Test
```

**note**: we can subclass a module as a component, but not the other way around. A component is expected to represent a specific component.

This subclassing is also useful for creating typed interfaces:

```ato
interface I2C:
    signal sda
    signal scl

module SomeModule:
    i2c = new I2C

module Test:
    a = new SomeModule
    b = new SomeModule
    a.i2c ~ b.i2c  # connects both sda and scl in one fell swoop
```

## `->` the replace operator

This operator allows you to increase the specificity of a block somewhere.

Take the following example:
1. You want to create a reusable half-bridge module
2. If you spec the FETs within the module, you can't readily reuse the design in other projects with other FETs
3. If you don't declare the FETs at the bottom level it's a PITA to use, since every time you ues it you need to remember to slot the FET in the right spot

You want some way to to say "we're putting a FET here, but we'll tell you which FET later"

Subclassing is the way you say what a FET is, the replacement operator gives you the later.

```ato
module NFET:
    signal gate
    signal source
    signal drain

module HalfBridge:
    signal high
    signal low
    signal output
    signal high_gate
    signal low_gate

    high_fet = new NFET
    low_fet = new NFET

    # let's pretend we do something useful here like hook it all up

# some time later... perhaps in another file

component SomeNFET from NFET:
    footprint = "TO-220-3_Vertical"  # this isn't a legit package, but you get the idea

module MotorController:
    a = new HalfBridge
    # ...
    # replace the fets with a SomeNFET
    a.high_fet -> SomeNFET
    a.low_fet -> SomeNFET
```

# Version control using git

## Get stuff from the server / sync
git fetch origin <some-branch>
git pull

## Make a new branch

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

`git checkout -b <branch-name> <from-branch>`

eg. `git checkout -b mawildoer/new-feature origin/main`

## Save some work

### 1.

`git add <whatever-you-wanna-save>`

`git add .`  -- save everything I've changed (including perhaps things we forgot to `.gitignore`)

### 2.

`git commit`

`git commit -m "<message-here>"`

## Push it back for everyone else

`git push` works if you didn't spec a "from" branch in `git checkout -b ...`

`git push -u origin HEAD` always works

Will respond with a way to make a branch:

```
